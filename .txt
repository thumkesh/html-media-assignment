1. Write a simple program in HTML  that displays the heading "HTML defines the content and structure of your 
website” on the web browser.


Solution==
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>html defines the content and structure of our website</h1>
</body>
</html>


2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML 
document.


Solution==
html comments are enclosed in <!-- and ends with -->.Everything between the tags is considerd a comment and will be ignored by the browser
Comments in HTML serve as non-rendered text that provides information about the code for human readers. 
They are useful for documenting your code, explaining its purpose, making notes, or temporarily disabling parts 
of the code without deleting them. Comments are ignored by browsers and do not affect the rendering of the 
webpage.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>akash</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</h1>
   <!--   <h1>sahil</h1>-->  <!-- the content is not getting rendered -->
   
</body>
</html>

 If you remove the <!-- and --> around 
the <p> tag, the paragraph will be displayed

3. Write an HTML program that includes a heading, a paragraph of text, a horizontal line, and a line break. 
Arrange these elements to create a simple web page layout.


Solution==
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>html defines the content and structure of our website</h1>
    
</body>
</html>


4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.
Tag==

HTML is a text-based language,which means that it is made up of text and tags.Tags are used to mark up the 
text in a way that tells the browser how to display it. For example, the <h1>tag is used to mark up a heading, and
the3<p>3tag3is3used to mark up a paragraph

ELEMENTS==
* <h1>,<h2>,...,<h6>:Heading elements used for defining different levels of headings on the page, with <h1>
being the most important and <h6> the least important´
* <p>: Represents a paragraph of text
* <a>: Creates a hyperlink to another web page or resource The href attribute specifies the URL
* <img>:This tag is used to insert an image
* <br>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>my first page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is graph</p>
</body>
<h1> Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>heading 3</h3>
<h4>heading 4</h4>
<h5>heading 5</h5>
<h6>heading 6</h6>

<p>sample paragraph</p>
<a href="https://www.google.com">GOOGLE</a>
<br />
</html>


And we have many more elements

5. What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?


Answer:

The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is a special instruction placed at the beginning of an HTML document to 
specify the version of HTML being used. It ensures proper rendering and parsing by web browsers. The most 
common declaration, <!DOCTYPE html>, indicates the use of HTML5, the latest version of HTML
